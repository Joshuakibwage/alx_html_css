# The goal of this project was to create a page according to ALX image template, using the skills learned from html and css.

I am quite satisfied with the result of the project. The page is very close to the corresponding design of the model and I learned a lot during the project. Of course, there is still a lot to improve, especially in code optimization and the use of selectors, but they will improve over time.
